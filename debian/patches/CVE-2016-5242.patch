Subject: [PATCH] xen/arm: Don't free p2m->first_level in p2m_teardown() before
 it has been allocated

If p2m_init() didn't complete successfully, (e.g. due to VMID
exhaustion), p2m_teardown() is called and unconditionally tries to free
p2m->first_level before it has been allocated.  free_domheap_pages() doesn't
tolerate NULL pointers.

This is XSA-181
