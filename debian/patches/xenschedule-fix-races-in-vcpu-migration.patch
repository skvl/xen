Subject: xen/schedule: Fix races in vcpu migration

The current sequence to initiate vcpu migration is inefficent and error-prone:

- The initiator sets VPF_migraging with the lock held, then drops the
  lock and calls vcpu_sleep_nosync(), which immediately grabs the lock
  again

- A number of places unnecessarily check for v->pause_flags in between
  those two

- Every call to vcpu_migrate() must be prefaced with
  vcpu_sleep_nosync() or introduce a race condition; this code
  duplication is error-prone

- In the event that v->is_running is true at the beginning of
  vcpu_migrate(), it's almost certain that vcpu_migrate() will end up
  being called in context_switch() as well; we might as well simply
  let it run there and save the duplicated effort (which will be
  non-negligible).

The result is that Credit1 has several races which result in runqueue
<-> v->processor invariants being violated (triggering ASSERTs in
debug builds and strange bugs in production builds).

Instead, introduce vcpu_migrate_start() to initiate the process.
vcpu_migrate_start() is called with the scheduling lock held.  It not
only sets VPF_migrating, but also calls vcpu_sleep_nosync_locked()
(which will automatically do nothing if there's nothing to do).

Rename vcpu_migrate() to vcpu_migrate_finish().  Check for v->is_running and
pause_flags & VPF_migrating at the top and return if appropriate.

Then the way to initiate migration is consistently:

* Grab lock
* vcpu_migrate_start()
* Release lock
* vcpu_migrate_finish()

+ * Initiating migration
+ *
+ * In order to migrate, we need the vcpu in question to have stopped
+ * running and had SCHED_OP(sleep) called (to take it off any
+ * runqueues, for instance); and if it is currently running, it needs
+ * to be scheduled out.  Finally, we need to hold the scheduling locks
+ * for both the processor we're migrating from, and the processor
+ * we're migrating to.
+ *
+ * In order to avoid deadlock while satisfying the final requirement,
+ * we must release any scheduling lock we hold, then try to grab both
+ * locks we want, then double-check to make sure that what we started
+ * to do hasn't been changed in the mean time.
+ *
+ * These steps are encapsulated in the following two functions; they
+ * should be called like this:
+ *
+ *     lock = vcpu_schedule_lock_irq(v);
+ *     vcpu_migrate_start(v);
+ *     vcpu_schedule_unlock_irq(lock, v)
+ *     vcpu_migrate_finish(v);
+ *
+ * vcpu_migrate_finish() will do the work now if it can, or simply
+ * return if it can't (because v is still running); in that case
+ * vcpu_migrate_finish() will be called by context_saved().
